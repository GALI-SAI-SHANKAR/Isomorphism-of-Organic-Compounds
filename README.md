<ul>
  <li> In Chemical bond structure, first dataset of chemical structure is to be collected then study each and every structure of bond. </li>
  <li> Structure of chemical bond is very different than normal graph hence it becomes very tedious job to apply graph isomorphism algorithms for such kinds of structure. </li>
  <li> Here also first convert bond structure in relevant graph format then go for graph isomorphism. </li>
  <li> In Chemical bond structure, each node has a unique identification number. If in case it is changed in that case it is assumed that chemical structure is changed. </li>
</ul>
